**Hey Captain!**

I'm *Vardan*, a software engineer living and working on the Earth. 

Having a brain with unlimited abilities and capacity is great. I don't have one, so whatever you see here is just an archive, collection of records about what time leaves behind and what future will bring. 

I use this platform of mine not for self-promotion, but for mutual education.
