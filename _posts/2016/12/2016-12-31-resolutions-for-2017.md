title: My Resolutions for 2017
---

I won't be the first one to tell that 2016 was a hard year. Looking back though, I could accomplish almost everything I planned for the year. Without getting sentimental, I can think of the following wrap-up ;)

### What happened in 2016

- This was my 3rd year in Berlin. It's a tough city to learn German, however I'm proud that I was able to get **B1 certificate**; I feel very much comfortable now living here, I'd say **language barrier is destroyed** finally! Beside learning the language, getting certificate was particularly important for me - I'm a self learner and was preparing for an exam for 4 months at home, without going to language courses, so certificate is a small reward.
- I started to **live _healthy_**, literally. This includes eating healthy food, and doing exercises 3 times a week.
- I learned how to **make coffee**! More precise, I learned how to make good coffee. In fact, my _morning coffee ceremonies_ help me to have a good start of a day.

~~(now switching the context)~~

- I learned how to **build RESTfull API's**. Sounds weird on one side, as I am working on API's for a very long time. However, it was an interesting year with a great learnings and only now I feel comfortable to tell that I have some opinion on that topic.
- I've talked about this a lot in my blog, so will keep it short. I started my **studies on algorithms**, this is very interesting and exciting, but never ending process and I hope to write a lot about it in 2017.
- I've learned a **new programming language**. Yes, it's Kotlin! With the help of it I started to have a deep (this word is important here) interest on functional programming languages (more on this below).
- Ah, **I started a blog. I love it now**.

### What comes next?

- I'm going to **learn cooking**. I've some skills now, but all those books at home ~~(my wife's personal collection)~~ about art of cooking are so attractive!
- I'm going to **learn Spanish**. 
- I really hope to **start practicing meditation**. This is one of the most challenging tasks, and is pending from this year.
- Of course there is going to be a new programming language. It is **Scala**. I'm in process already, I love it and have something to share with you soon.
- I want to understand what the hell is **Data Science**. I'll try to share my learnings and also open source small projects ;)
- I feel like it's time to give back something to the community. I'm planning to actively **contribute to open source projects** which are waiting for my commits!

Last by not least, I'm moving to write code for [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com){:target="_blank"} soon! This is very exciting and challenging itself! 

Meanwhile, I'm still in [Friendsurance](https://www.friendsurance.de/){:target="_blank"} where I spent my year, so don't forget to contact in case you want to [work](https://www.friendsurance.de/jobs){:target="_blank"} with us.
